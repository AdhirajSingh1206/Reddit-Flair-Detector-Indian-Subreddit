Why does the government come with a begging bowl during every crisis?,636,fxofyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxofyu/why_does_the_government_come_with_a_begging_bowl/,207,1586448261.0,"We have floods, terrorist attacks, famines due to lack of rain, pandemic etc. After every such incident we see the governemnt approaching us with a begging bowl (PM CARES fund this time)

We pay so  much money as tax, Be it on automobles, petrol, cigarettes, liquor, income tax, tax on electronics like laptops, mobile phones, toll on highways

Bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during time of crisis. 

Its not that they are providing pothole free roads, swift public transport, education or healthcare for that tax. Fine - Don't provide all these basic services but at least the government should not come with a begging bowl during each crisis!

The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?"," I don't understand why they don't use money from contingency fund .. there's a separate fund called contingency fund 


>
Contingency Fund of India:
This fund is being held by the President of India. He can spend from this fund for emergency and unforeseen circumstances. No authorization from Parliament is required,

Public Accounts of India:
1. Bank savings account of the departments/ministries
2. National Investment fund
3. National Calamity & contingency fund (NCCF)
4. National small savings fund, defence fund.¬¬
5. Prarambhik Shishak Kosh, MNREGA fund
6. Provident fund, Postal insurance etc. and so on
No permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account.

Consolidated Fund of India:
All the cash from direct and indirect taxes, all the loans that are taken by the government of India and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government. This is the largest of all three funds. The government needs parliament's approval to spend money from this fund
> The amount of money we pay as our taxes... They use it to gain goodwill for their parties(state or center) by freeing loans, water, electricity, transport and even their election campaigns. So in the time of actual needs, they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis. The Govt of India (central Govt.) runs a fiscal deficit every year. This means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise. Note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs.

The GoI doesn't earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to a multitude of factors. India has a large unorganised ""off the books"" sector which doesn't pay taxes, the Indian state doesn't have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them, etc. This results in the only reliable revenue streams for the Govt being salaried tax payers, GST collected and some other taxes. From this, GST payments have been less than projected because the Govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post-GST.

Now, a large chunk of the Govt.'s expenditure goes into schemes for the ""upliftment of the poor"" and ""rural development"", etc etc. The problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself. By the 'state' I mean people who are a part of the state, ie: politicians and bureaucrats.

So taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism, to gain favour with the electorate so they're elected again, etc. A lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption. Bureaucrats tasked with building 10 toilets might only build 2 and pocket the funds allocated for the other 8.

This is how taxpayer money in India is only used to serve politicians' and bureaucrats' interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society 'uplifted'.

There is no accountability and no transparency. potholed roads, slow public transport, namesake education and healthcare It's not a begging bowl. It's a psychological tactic, they know you'll donate when the country is going through a crisis ""even when we have enough money to handle the crisis"" and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks. 
>The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?


Because generations of people before you decided a spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our Indian culture. Now,those with spines exploit,and everyone spineless suffers. Blame the populace.thats where all the govt employees come from. Because if they have to give out from the government's kitty, it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot. India is poor - its a banal and boring answer but it is still true.

India needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels.

India needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure (non corrupt officers, people used to following the law - the habits of civilization)

Our tax income isn't superb. Our usage of money isn't super - we leak all over the place.

This means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during a crisis.

It also gives people a way to help - which is what most civilized people do. They feel bad when they see someone in trouble, and want to help, This is one way to do so. Dont you ever question where your tax money goes. cant you see the tallest and most beautiful statue that has a natural cooling system whenever it rains, was built in India. Which country provides this much comfort ? Don't forget that 3000cr statue and 20,000cr Rajpath renovation.
And why the fuck politicians don't pay tax? It's called corruption bro. How else will they get their chai-paani"
"Men who are 30+ and have decided not to get married, what is your plan for old age?",264,fvy95j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvy95j/men_who_are_30_and_have_decided_not_to_get/,215,1586206585.0,"The corona virus has given me some time to think about my life choices a bit. I am 32, male and have decided not to get married. Its not my thing. But I will be honest, I am worried about old age, not so much about loneliness but about sickness, weakness, inability to look after myself, financial support (I can still plan for this). In India, I think people still rely on their children to take care of them in their sunset years. I will take care of my parents until their last day. But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?

Any body who have decided not to get married and have figured out their plans for old age?"," Plan your finances. Work and enjoy in your own ways when you are healthy. Go see the world. Then move to an assisted living apartments when you are retired from working. Don't wait to become a cabbage to move to such living. Make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there. Am 37 and unmarried. I think my only fear is medical emergencies. 

Rest all can be managed I think you are missing the point of marriage. 

It’s less to do with spousal/children support as you grow old, and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships. As a 65 year old, let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences I have had in my life. It has completed me. She is now 30plus, doing her own thing, in another country, and I certainly don’t expect her to come and stay and look after me when I am old and infirm. And I cannot but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter. 

My wife is my age, and we have now started the journey of looking after one another. When she was ill, I stayed by her side, and when I suffered a heart attack recently, she stayed by mine. And we keep fussing over each other. It’s called growing old together. 

But yes, I did plan financially for my older years, and those plans have more or less come to fruition. But that’s just a bonus. The main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships, although I will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems. But when you put everything on a scale, I would gladly go through all this again and again. 

So don’t look at marriage as a prop for your old age. That’s silly. Look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships,  and going through the joys, the trials and the tribulations of parenthood. I am 31 and single. The point of marriage is not to find a woman who'll replace my mother. If that is the need then I'll get a nurse in old age or go to an old age home. 

Unless I don't find a partner who has a similar mindset, has a personality of her own, is equally ambitious and will carry on in future even if I am not around, there is no point in saying yes to a random woman just for the sake of someone being there when I am old. 

I have seen couples who got married at 26 and have spent 4-5 years just quarreling and arguing on pety topics. People who didn't get a chance to understand each other before marriage and are now regretting. I don't want to live in such a marriage. 

My parents forced me into engineering and after two years I realised that this place is not for me. The argument that my parents used to send me to this Engg College was that it will give you a well settled lifestyle and secure future. After a year I was suicidal. Now if I get married because it is a guarantee to secure old age and not because I really like the girl (and she likes me back) then chances are that I (or both of us) will end up in a similar situation and I won't get an option like dropping out of this course without thinking of some serious repercussions. Its crazy to me how many people in India look at marriage and kids as an ""investment for the future"" rather than the personal relationship they are supposed to be at the present. Guess that's why arranged marriages and the pressure to marry is so common. Its not so much a natural alignment of 2 people sharing their lives and more like a cold business transaction? Its quite strange. Hmm.. a lot of people have expressed their opinions.. as of me, I’m almost in the same boat as you.. my suggestion is to start saving and invest in PPF, FD & KVP. Eat healthy and exercise.. when you’re old and single, go to a old age home.. Shotgun to my face. That's my plan for, when I'm old. > not so much about loneliness

Let me ask you a question. Do you feel lonely now? Do you have friends to hang out with frequently now? Or someone really close to you?

You don't have to answer that here. That's for yourself.

The point is people get married because it gets lonely after a while. Now I'm only 28 but I know for a fact that I can't live alone. If I could have a partner and not get married that's fine too. But people need stability, legal benefits and financial benefits. So most people prefer a marriage. Not to mention that it has a social meaning to it.

> But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?

It's funny how you feel this already and yet thought of not getting married. The point of marriage is companionship. Kids taking care of parents is such an old concept. Let the kids live free. It's only the parents responsibility to groom them, guide them and let them find their way. You do that out of love not out of obligation.

And if you don't want that responsibility, don't have kids!

You and your partner will take care of each other. And you have to plan for the worst case anyway in case you become all alone.

Hope you find your way. I plan to never get married. There are several reasons for it, failed marriage of my parents is one of them, but i just don’t know how to convince my parents. Following are the challenges.

1) my mom always tell me what will society think, like am i gay or something. No i am not but if I don’t get married my parents will get embarrassed by this things

2) my parents said i will feel very alone and will get depressed when i will come home and there will be no one to welcome me. (Like i am not already depressed haha)

3) our society just treats single men as a threat. How to handle that.

This is all i can think of right now, and i am really messed up to have any relationship ever. So option of getting married is off the table. Just how to explain this to parents. Future is here bro don't worry I'm 25 I decided not to get married even I told this to my parents
The best idea is savings then you can afford everything
In future, old age home and care is going to be a big business so don't worry I'm so relieved to see so many people in the Same boat.

Even I share the same fears about my sunset years.."
Found my autograph diary while going through some of my old stuff. Here is Dr Kalam's autograph I took 16 years ago.,5037,fyc817,https://i.redd.it/ko5pldcvgyr41.jpg,151,1586538002.0,," He had come to my school but teachers only introduced their favorite students. I cried for two days after I couldn't meet him. I was heartbroken. Can you show us what other autographs you have too? Something to be preserved and what a great man he was! It's a good thing he isn't here to see this nation today. Shut up! Take this diary and frame it in a thick plate. Where did you meet him OP? This is gold! I was just planning to read his autobiography again today.

Hey OP, Please get it framed! :) Just President of India. My man you are underselling him. I was lucky enough to see him at two feet's distance when he came to our college in Mumbai in 2013.

He was swarmed by security as he was leaving the college and I got close to him as I can beholding his glorious mop of white hair.

Never has the death of a person who I don't know saddened me as much as Dr. Kalam's did.

Though not comparable, I understood how millions of Indians felt when Gandhi died or Americans when hearing that Kennedy was assassinated. I have said this before and I will say this at every opportunity I get:
 I WANT APJ ABDUL KALAM ON MY CURRENCY NOTES. Did somebody else write the name and date or did he use a different ink for some reason? This makes me so sad. Back in Class 2, I was a bright student, always taking part in extracurricular activities apart from getting top grades. Once Dr Kalam visited our school, but the children of teachers were chosen to welcome him. I cried horribly after the incident."

On Twitter, I can be followed at @free_thinker, and Alt News can be followed at @AltNews.

Please feel free to ask me questions about the issue of misinfo/disinfo, about Alt News, about what the social media platforms are doing, and more."," How does one join your team full-time and part-time? What type of roles do you have? Do you like to eat mangoes? What's your business model? In how many ways do you generate revenue? I suggest everyone listen to the episode ""Fighting Fake News"" in the Seen and Unseen Podcast with Amit Verma. I watched it and learnt a lot about you. I want to Thank you for the brilliant work you are doing. Such work requires a lot of personal sacrifices and I'm sure there are lacs who appreciate it.

I have only one question:

What do you see as AltNews biggest threat today? How can the average Indian help you combat this? Can you guys develop something like a browser extension which can automatically alert about a fake news page when visited. For example, anti virus software indicate weather a web page has malicious links etc. [removed] Do you ever get threat calls by Political parties for exposing fake news? You are doing all your work from Ahmedabad. How do you do verification of information in other cities when someone has to go physically to a place. I'm sure many of us would be ready to volunteer our services in these cases. Do you keep records of who shares the most amount of fake news on Twitter? Would love to see a chart listing the top 25 fake news tweeters in India and share it on Whatsapp in all my groups. I have a feeling that M Kishwar will top the charts if one is prepared Pratik, do you believe in religion/concept of an omnipotent higher power? Hi Pratik,
Been a follower since Alt news inception. Great work, big fan..!
I just wonder why ALT NEWS is not getting much popularity that it deserves. Hire a PR agency may be?

Like how can a salaried person get into politics? Can be a bit easy for people with business and family to support it, but what about others? And by politics i mean proper politics, not volunteer. Is AAP planning to expand? I believe that is the only way to curb air pollution for North. 

Also do you believe AAP needs more leaders upfront other than Kejriwal?

What are Key Reasons for failure in May elections? 

Do you believe announcing all your strategies openly makes AAP vulnerable to counter strategies from opponents?

Hope you expand and develop North. Cheers and Thanks. As an MLA how difficult is it for you guys to get in touch with ground realities

And I know. AAP MLAs are better in touch with their constituents, what do you think makes other party MLAs not get in touch with their people? You once led a march to Chief Ministers office over dengue deaths, if am not wrong. Do you feel Arvind Kejriwal is dictatorial?

Is there any kind of hierarchy in AAPs party structure or everyone is equal?

Any dark secrets about the system you learned after becoming a politician and an MLA? Thanks for this (and everything else you do)

1) How do you and the party keep working in the face of stiff, even criminal levels of harassment across party lines by the forces to be?

2) Will the lack of transparently sourced funds mean AAP will never find resources to grow beyond Delhi?

3) What are your challenges ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections? Thanks for doing this. I have a few questions.
1. According to you, what must we do as a society to stop the heinous crime that is rape from being so rampant in our country? What role do politicians play in all of this?
2. What are your views on the situation of news media in India? What can we do to improve it?
3. Where does AAP stand in the country’s political scenario? It doesn’t seem to be the ‘holier than thou’ political organisation that it initially was. If you could describe the party to a common citizen in a single sentence to convince them to vote for you, what would it be?
4. What are your views about the ‘atmosphere of fear’ as Rahul Bajaj phrased it? Does it exist? Does it not? What do we do about it?

Might be a bit long lol What is the biggest challenge in fighting mafias, and how successful have you been? What did you do to achieve it? With the recent mass legalization of cannabis across the world and a lot of it's benefits coming to light, what is your party's stance on its legalization for personal and/or industrial use?


 what is your opinion on the trans rights bill?


Does your party support legalization of gay marriage? How can we help you in the elections? Namashkar sir! 

1>The delhi govt promised to provide free WiFi access across delhi but it hasn't been the case on ground What has been the progress on that front? How many CCTVs out of the 1.5lakh promised by the Hon'ble CM  have been installed uptill now in Delhi?

2>The Delhi Govt's string of announcements in the past few months like making rides free for women,the grant on  electricity bills upto a certain unit consumption,filling exam fees of students may be extremely noble and good in principle but certainly put strain on the delhi govt's treasure. How does the delhi govt plan to compensate and manage the govt's funds for the amount of concessions it's providing/intends to provide?"
