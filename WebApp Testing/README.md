# Systen integrated Testing:
A custom script (Automated_testing.py) was written to send POST request containing a file.txt which contains links of Reddit posts in each line, to the automated testing route, validating its functioning.

A JSON file is returned as response which contains the sent links as keys and their predicted Flairs as the value to the pair.
